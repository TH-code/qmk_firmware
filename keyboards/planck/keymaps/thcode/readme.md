# TH-code layout

_This keymap is trying to stay closer to the macbook keyboards and bluetooth 
external keyboard. Trying out the default layout had me missing keys and
structurally typing the wrong ones._

## Changes
- Swap TAB and ESC
- Swap |\ and ENTER
- Add ± and §, not really using them, but others might
- Add a function layer and move the f keys there
- In function, lower and raise swap backspace with KC_DEL
- Single purpose ESC (for plover move EXIT there too), no more DEL
- Remove the doubled f keys from raise and lower
- Add mac equivalents of F row to lower
- Swap Command (GUI) and Ctrl instead of Command (GUI) and ALT, seems to make 
  more sense if you move from regular mac use to sporadic windows/linux use
